# SMPTE_Bars_Turtle
# SMPTE Bars in RGB using Turtle module in Python

# Referred to codepen.io site for hex values except for White and Black, which I set to 100% so #FFFFFF and #000000

# Another interesting page with calculations and hex values for the SMPTE bars: http://avisynth.nl/index.php/ColorBars_theory#100.2F0.2F100.2F0_bars_using_Rec.601_coefficients

# This was mostly just for fun but I would be curious if there is any use case where this could possibly be better than a .png or other image file when calibrating very new or very old monitors, for example.
